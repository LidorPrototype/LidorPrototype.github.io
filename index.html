                This project is made for an automatic web scraping to collect data for machine learning and deep learning projects.<br>
                This project have 2 versions Streamlit and FastAPI version (Streamlit is the older one), services include but not limited to:
                Raw (scraping based on similarities), API downloading, downloading various formats from the website <a href="https://maya.tase.co.il/">Maya</a>,
                scraping the web based on user queries, PDF files parsing, Scrape predefined specific content from the <a href="https://apis.cbs.gov.il">OECD</a> website.
                FastAPI version also include management services like: sending an email, handling tables data in Azure Data Lake, handling Airflow DAGs creation and suitable data in Azure Blob Containers.<br>
                The project is using Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy and other libraries.

                Here you will find a collection of implementations of virtual assistants implemented in Python.<br>
                Chatbots are intelligent enough to sense the context of the conversation and execute the right bot flow. However, chatbots cannot find answers or perform a set of activities on their own.
                On the other hand, a virtual assistant can crawl through existing resources and offer assistance for a wide range of requests.

                A list of few different web scrapers I created (for Amazon, Twitter, IMDb and more)<br>
                Each scraper works in a different way, some need input or limits from the person operating the scripts.
                Libraries I used for this including but not limited to are BeautifulSoup, Selenium, csv, requests, re and more.

                HashTables are data structures that support these three operations:<br>
                1. Adding an element<br>
                2. Removing an element<br>
                3. Searching for an element .<br>
                The HashTable implemented by using an
                array that at each index of the array, there is a pointer to a linked list.
                The HashTable is support int and strings.

                There is always one socket where the server listens to connections and for each client connection request,
